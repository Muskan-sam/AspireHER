Women-Techies hackathon

THEME: Women empowerment

Our idea is to build a website that can provide a platform to women of different age groups, to explore the various opportunities out there in educational and work field, like competitions / scholarships / internships / events and conferences / part time or full time job opportunities that are available to them. 
This website will help increase awareness among women about the opportunities that they have in the education and work sector, motivate them to work on their skills and grab their share of opportunity, give them the details about each opportunity (the timeline, eligibility criteria, application procedure)  and help them apply to opportunity by redirecting them directly to the application portals.
We are also providing them the chance to write a blog post of their experience in a particular competition / conference / event and their achievements that will be featured on our website and be a source of motivation for the other women.
